## About INVITE-ME-APP
 This is a personal project to simulate a invitation card but with all the advantages that an Angular Web project can provide.
 I'm doing this for my son's 3 years old party. So, I'm sending this to my guests.

 I'm building this project with these main sections:

 - A Welcome pop-up.
 - A header with a menu to select the different sections of the card.
 - A main-info section with the name of the host (my son's name).
 - A Where-When-info section to indicate the place name, time, address, etc. of the party.
 - A photo section with some photographs of my son.
 - A family info section with the members of our family.
 - A video section with a link to Youtube's video of our family.
 - A ending info section with a message to our guests.
